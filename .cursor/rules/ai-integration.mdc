# AI Integration Guide

## Anthropic Claude Integration
The project uses Anthropic's Claude API for intelligent code rewriting in [src/rewrite.ts](mdc:src/rewrite.ts).

## Environment Configuration
- **Required**: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env` file
- **API Client**: Uses `@anthropic-ai/sdk` package
- **Model**: Configured to use Claude for code analysis and rewriting

## Rewrite Functionality
The `rewrite` command processes compressed/minified JavaScript:
1. Reads minified/compressed code files
2. Sends code to Claude API with specific prompts
3. Receives readable, well-formatted code
4. Saves rewritten code to output files

## AI Prompt Strategy
- Focus on making compressed code readable
- Preserve original functionality
- Add meaningful variable names
- Improve code structure and comments
- Handle various JavaScript compression techniques

## Usage Pattern
```bash
urcrx rewrite --path /path/to/compressed-code.js
```

## Future AI Enhancements (TODOs)
- Token usage tracking and limitations
- Integration with multiple LLM providers
- Automatic codebase documentation generation
- Conversational interface for recovered code

## Best Practices
- Always backup original files before rewriting
- Review AI-generated code for accuracy
- Test rewritten code functionality
- Monitor API usage and costs
